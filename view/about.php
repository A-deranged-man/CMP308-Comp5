    <h4>Introduction & Education</h4>

        <img src="../images/headshot.jpeg" style="padding-left: 20px;" height="400" width="300"/>
        <p>My interest began for computing in 2010. At this time I didn't know much about programming, but rather
            I had began experimenting with basic software hacking using Hex Editors, Password Crackers and Memory Injection Tools whilst also executing basic
            network hacking with Packet Sniffers.
        </p>

        <p>After School I attended Dumfries & Galloway College and achieved Distinction* in both my BTEC Level 2 & BTEC Level 3 Diplomas,
            which were taken in 2015 & 2016 respectively. After finishing my Diplomas I went on to achieve a B in HNC Computer Sciences and an A in HND Computer Sciences.
            These courses allowed me to realise my passion for software development. I am particularly fond of PHP and Python, and also enjoy creating applications in Java for desktop and Android devices.

    <h4>Progression</h4>

        <p>After my education in Dumfries & Galloway College I began working as a Website Product Administrator for ETB Technologies Ltd.
        Here I learned how to deploy content on a Magento 2 CMS and created multiple programs to improve the workflow for staff at ETB, such as automatic stock
        sync programs built in Python 3, or data comparison programs for Microsoft Dynamics NAV.</p>
        <br>

    <h4>Current Day</h4>
        <p>Currently I am a student at Abertay, I am doing a BSc (Hons) Computing course with aims to achieve a First in my Degree.
            After this I hope to work for a software or web development company for a few years, then I aim to come back to Abertay to acquire a Masters Degree in
            Ethical Hacking.
