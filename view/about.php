    <h4>Introduction</h4>

        <p>We are a four man team based in the midlands of Scotland studying at Abertay University.
        </p>

        <p>We aim to deliver high quality applications at a low cost using the Agile development methodology known as SCRUM.
        </p>
        <br>

    <h4>Development</h4>

        <p>After being approached by Jacques to develop an educational application to assist students and teachers in their learning we took this as a good challenge to prove our development and teamwork skills.</p>
